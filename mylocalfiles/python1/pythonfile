#conditional statements#
Python conditional statements 
 
 
--- If Statement

The `if` statement is used to test a specific condition. If the condition is true, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.


# Example 1: Check if a number is positive
number = 10

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")


--- If-Else Statement

The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.


# Example 2: Check if a number is positive or negative
number = -5

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")


--- If-Elif-Else Statement

The `if-elif-else` statement is used to test multiple conditions.


# Example 3: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
number = 0

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")


--- Nested If Statement

An `if` statement can be nested inside another `if` statement.


# Example 4: Check if a number is positive and even
number = 8

if number > 0:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("The number is positive and even.")
    else:
        print("The number is positive but not even.")
else:
    print("The number is not positive.")


--- Practice Problems

Here are some problems to practice:

1. **Check if a number is even or odd.**
   
   number = 7
   # Write your code here
   

2. **Check if a person is eligible to vote. (Assume voting age is 18)**
   
   age = 20
   # Write your code here
   

3. **Check if a year is a leap year.**
   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except if it is also divisible by 400.
   
   year = 2024
   # Write your code here
   

4. **Check the grade of a student based on marks.**
   - A: 90-100
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - D: 60-69
   - F: <60
   
   marks = 85
   # Write your code here
   

--- Solutions

1. **Check if a number is even or odd:**
   
   number = 7

   if number % 2 == 0:
       print("The number is even.")
   else:
       print("The number is odd.")
   

2. **Check if a person is eligible to vote:**
   
   age = 20

   if age >= 18:
       print("Eligible to vote.")
   else:
       print("Not eligible to vote.")
   

3. **Check if a year is a leap year:**
   
   year = 2024

   if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
       print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
   else:
       print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
   

4. **Check the grade of a student based on marks:**
   
   marks = 85

   if 90 <= marks <= 100:
       print("Grade: A")
   elif 80 <= marks < 90:
       print("Grade: B")
   elif 70 <= marks < 80:
       print("Grade: C")
   elif 60 <= marks < 70:
       print("Grade: D")
   else:
       print("Grade: F")
